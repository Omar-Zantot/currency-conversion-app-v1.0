## Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing to our project! To ensure a smooth and organized development process, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Branching Strategy**: Do not make direct changes to the `master` branch. Instead, follow the branching strategy outlined below:

   - Create a new branch for each separate feature, bug fix, or enhancement you're working on.
   - Use descriptive branch names that reflect the nature of your changes.
   - Once your changes are ready, open a pull request (PR) from your branch to the `master` branch.

2. **Pull Requests (PRs)**:
   - All changes must be submitted as pull requests.
   - Provide a clear and concise description of the changes in your pull request.
   - Ensure that your code is well-documented and follows our coding standards.

3. **Code Review**:
   - Pull requests will undergo code review by maintainers.
   - Be responsive to feedback and make necessary changes based on code review comments.

By adhering to these guidelines, we can maintain a clean and organized codebase, facilitate collaboration, and ensure that changes are properly reviewed before being merged.

Thank you for your contributions!
